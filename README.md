Hey there! This repo is where I keep all my Python assignments from university. It’s mostly about the basics – functions, loops, data handling, and some problem-solving stuff.

I'm sharing these to track my progress and maybe help others who are learning too. Feel free to check things out, leave feedback, or just see how I'm growing in Python.
